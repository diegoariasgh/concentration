My original intention with this project was to use a set of attractors to create an harmonic movement that would represent how our focus or attention evolves over a time span.

My goal was to create a pleasant shape that would be deformed as time advances, with some movers falling out of the shape (similarly to how some lost birds sway after the flock).

Originally, I got started using the synthax we had seen in class, wotking with the cookie cutter to create movers and attractors.

I was trying to use another for() loop for the attractors, however, in the draw function, the synthax  posed some issues that I could not solve, so I decided to hand code the attractors into 5 different positions and re-work the way the balls appeared and how there was a gravitational force that would pull them towards the attractors.

When adding more improvements, I started using other things we had seen in class: the liquid, a drag force, and removing some other attractors to play with the effect created by the forces.

After several versions and modifications were added, the result was very pleasing. I wanted to then work with some styling details to achieve a feel that would be more consistent with the story. I added some transparency and random colors to the movers, hid the attractors and then I had some more plans, but I ran into a few Issues.

I asked Aaron for help, and after meeting, he gave me a few ideas that worked very well with what I was trying to achieve: rather than using random colors, I used a color palette; and for the final moment (the loss of attention, the dispersion) I added a repeller. Although what would have been the most effective way to program was inverting the force of an attractor, I created a whole new class for it because I ran into a few debugging issues. This is something that can be improved upone later deliveries, as well as maybe cleaning up the code and combining for() loops for the movers and attractors and the forces applied among them.

Here is a video that shows the whole sketch. The color palette and the repeller in the end were the little details that in my opinion elevated the project, aesthetically speaking, to a higher level.

I was happy with this project because after altering and iterating for a while, the final result was very enjoyable. I uploaded the final code to my github, and it can be found here.

This project was developed for Decoding Nature, fall 18. NYU Abu Dhabi
